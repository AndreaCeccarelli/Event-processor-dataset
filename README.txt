The archive contains the following files and folders:
- EventModel_complete.png: the Event Model contains the whole picture of the Event Model used for the experiments.

- ontology.owl: Ontology contains the whole ontology used and described in the paper abovementioned.

- folder Correlation Rules: the entire set of rules used for the experiments

- folder Correlation Example Test: three sample microevents and a sample macroevent, just for the purpose of clarifying the inputs and outputs we use

- Folder RealDeployment: includes a large set of events that were collected during multiple different phases of our analyses, 
in different temporal periods. These includes data generated using sensor networks dispatched in Piazza dei Miracoli, data extracted from tweets.

- The three remaining folders contains the results, or the tools, used for the experiments reported in Sections 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 of the paper above.

In details:

- Folder Section 6.1 contains the microevents used as inputs for the experiments in Section 6.1 of the abovementioned paper

- Folder Section 6.2 contains the code of the R tool and the data for simulatons of Section 6.2

- Folder Section 6.3 refers to Section 6.3 of the abovementioned paper. It contains the whole database where the macroevents generated for Weather Warning, Football Match, and Political Manifestation are stored; 
e.g., there are information on the events recorded and the resources used. An excel file summarizes the relevant macro-events extracted. 


N.B.: in some cases, you will not find a distinguished list of micro and macro-events. 
Micro-events are included in the macro-events (open a macro-event to see also the micro-events which composes it)
